# Build Your Own React

This repo contains my own custom React. It's simple but it does the trick.

But why? To learn of course! I want to start deconstructing cool things (like React) to learn more about them. If you have any other suggestions, let me know!

It was built by following [Rodrigo Pombo's](https://github.com/pomber) [awesome blog post on building your own React](https://pomb.us/build-your-own-react). I recommend you check it out. The learning experience on his website is incredible.
